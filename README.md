# The Leafy Bean Website

## Purpose

Many local businesses in Ireland have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic this year. 
Government restrictions have led to forced shop closures and continued uncertainty for small businesses. 
As consumers’ buying habits shift predominantly online, it’s more important than ever for small businesses to have a strong online presence during these challenging times. 

Based on the current climate, I have created a fictional local independent coffee shop called The Leafy Bean in Blackrock, Dublin. The Leafy Bean has a poor online presence and are struggling to reach their customers during the pandemic. They requested a fully responsive website which will allow them to notify their customers of their opening hours in line with government restrictions, as well as promote their new takeaway coffee service. 

Please note, this company is entirely fictional and was created for the Code Institute’s Milestone Project 1 as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. 
It was developed using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

Please see The Leafy Bean’s live website.
