# The Leafy Bean Website

## Purpose

Many local businesses in Ireland have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic this year. New
Government restrictions have led to shop closures and continued uncertainty for small businesses. 
As consumers’ buying habits shift predominantly online, it’s more important than ever for small businesses 
to have a strong online presence during these challenging times. 

I have created a fictional local independent coffee shop called The Leafy Bean in Blackrock, Dublin. 
The Leafy Bean has a poor online presence and are struggling to reach their customers during the pandemic. 
They requested a fully responsive website which will allow them to notify their customers of their opening hours 
in line with government restrictions, and promote their new takeaway coffee service. Furthermore, The Leafy Bean
wants to establish itself as a local provider of the best coffee in Blackrock and provide information about its 
speciality coffee blend.

Please note, this company is entirely fictional and was created for the Code Institute’s Milestone Project 1 
as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. It was developed using the knowledge gained 
from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

Please see [The Leafy Bean’s](#) live website.

## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are white and brown to tie in with The Leafy Bean's product offering - coffee. 
Adobe Color to create a colour swatch to find the right brown for this website.

A high-fidelity mockup for mobile was created using Adobe Illustrator to trial the use of colour and to allow for better 
visualisation of how the website would look prior to commencing coding.
