# The Leafy Bean Website

## Purpose

Many local businesses in Ireland have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic this year. New Government restrictions have led to shop closures and continued uncertainty for small businesses. As consumers’ buying habits shift predominantly online, it’s more important than ever for small businesses 
to have a strong online presence during these challenging times. 

I have created a fictional local independent coffee shop called The Leafy Bean in Blackrock, Dublin. The Leafy Bean has a poor online presence and are struggling to reach their customers during the pandemic. They requested a fully responsive website which will allow them to notify their customers of their opening hours in line with government restrictions, and promote their new takeaway coffee service. Furthermore, The Leafy Bean wants to establish itself as a local provider of the best coffee in Blackrock and provide information about its speciality coffee blend.

Please note, this company is entirely fictional and was created for the Code Institute’s Milestone Project 1 as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. It was developed using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

Please see [The Leafy Bean’s](#) live website.

## Design 

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used across the website are white and brown to tie in with The Leafy Bean's product offering - coffee. 

Adobe Color was used to create a colour swatch to find the right shade of brown for the site. A dark brown (Hex Code #695138) was used for H2 headings on the site and a lighter shade of brown for icons and buttons (Hex Code #8f6f4d). 

#### _Adobe Color Swatch_:

### Wireframes

The Leafy Bean's website is a single page site. Please see the wireframes below for the varying devices:

* [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/JessicaJuliet/the-leafy-bean/blob/86dd6b3e21eb27d3abd5b2a5c0b98fe7d6890ee4/assets/wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
* [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/JessicaJuliet/the-leafy-bean/blob/86dd6b3e21eb27d3abd5b2a5c0b98fe7d6890ee4/assets/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.pdf)

A high-fidelity mockup for mobile was also created using Adobe Illustrator to trial the use of colour and to allow for better visualisation of how the website would look prior to commencing coding.

### Fonts

The fonts originally chosen for this website were [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair), 
based on inspiration take from [The Art of Coffee](https://theartofcoffee.ie/) website. However, once I commenced building the site, 
I didn't feel that Playfair Display tied into the branding I had in mind for The Leafy Bean - a fun and modern coffee shop 
who's knowledgeable about their coffee! 

I trialed new fonts using Google Fonts and Google Chrome Developer tools to see sample text from The Leafy Bean's website in various fonts. Furthermore, I took guidance from Google Font's "Popular Pairings" to find new fonts.  

I decided to change Playfair Display to [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=roboto) instead. Roboto Slab offers a more fun font with its friendly and open curves, versus Playfair which has a more vintage feel to it.
